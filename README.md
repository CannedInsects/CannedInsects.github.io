I can sort of code, I dunno I'm trying my best

If you want to see my replit account here's the link :D https://replit.com/@Snimz 


### Stuff I like

1. Bugs
2. Horror Fiction Podcasts
3. Pet sites (Neopets, Goatlings, Webkinz etc)
4. Listening to music

### What kind of coding do I do exactly?
Personally I really like using turtle it's visual and it's fun to use! :D Other than that I can only really do basic python but I want to improve because I've always wanted to make a video game. 


### Links you can look at
A song I think is pretty neat: https://youtu.be/EeVMCOfYhJo  
Garfield: https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/2007/11/26  
(Pretend there's a link to my classmate's github, I still need to do that part)  

### Conclusion
Did you know one of the largest species of beetles are the Rhinoceros beetle, they can grow up to 6 inches and some people keep them as pets?  
That's not important I just think that's neat.
