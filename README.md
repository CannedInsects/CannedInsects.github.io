## Welcome to the cool kid zone 

I can sort of code, I dunno I'm trying my best

If you want to see my replit account here's the link :D https://replit.com/@Snimz 


### Stuff I like

1. Bugs
2. Horror Fiction Podcasts
3. Pet sites (Neopets, Goatlings, Webkinz etc)
4. Listening to music

### What kind of coding do I do exactly?
Personally I really like using turtle it's visual and it's fun to use! :D Other than that I can only really do basic python but I want to improve because I've always wanted to make a video game.
